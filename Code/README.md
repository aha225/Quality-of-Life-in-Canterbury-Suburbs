## Documentation for the Code Notebooks

The Code folder contains all the notebooks which were used to process the input files into the tables presented in the relational dataset. 

The notebooks can be grouped into two categories, the preprocessing notebook which take the raw input files for the Hospitals, Crashes, Crime and Schools and 
produce a processed table which is part of the relational dataset. These notebooks are the CanterburySchoolDirectoryProcessing.ipynb, CrashDataProcessing.ipynb, 
CrimeDataProcessing.ipynb and HospitalsProcessing.ipynb. Each notebook also produces Area Unit level aggregated information as columns in csv files which are 
combined together to form the final Area Unit Summary table. This process is done by the Area_Unit_Summary_Table_Creation.ipynb notebook.

The following instructions outline the files needed to run each notebook and the order in which they should be run.

### 1) Produce the orbiting processed tables and the aggregated area unit columns for the Area Unit Summary Table
